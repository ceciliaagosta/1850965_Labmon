# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:

The project is a browser monster collector game web application. Players can collect creatures by attempting captures during unique encounters. Players can only generate encounters by waiting a minimum amount of time, and rarity of the encountered creature depends on time passed between encounters. To have a better chance at capturing the creatures, players are able to use items. Items can be bought from an in-game shop using an in-game currency. This currency can only be earned by playing the game and “sharding” duplicate creatures, to also encourage the capture of duplicates. Players can view their collection and be awarded with in-game currency for completing one collection. Admins can manage the set of available creatures and items, using a dedicated section of the web app, being able to also create new collections for future longevity. Authentication is managed using JWT tokens, and a distinction exists between the admin and player role, to ensure players cannot cheat the game by accessing parts of the app outside of their boundary. The goal of the system is to be a productivity app, encouraging users to work from their laptop and taking periodic pauses from their activities to interact with the game. Less interaction means better rewards in terms of monster rarity, while still having something to look forward to when taking a break.
